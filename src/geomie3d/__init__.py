::
    
 create                     --- Functions for constructing topologies. e.g. construct a face
                                 dependencies: scipy, numpy (for delaunay function only)
 get                        --- Functions for getting information from the topologies. e.g. get points from face
 modify                     --- Functions for modifying the geometries. e.g. move the face from pointA to pointB
 calculate                  --- Functions for obtaining information from geometries through calculations.
                                 e.g. calculate the mid point of a face
 utility                    --- Functions that does not fit into the previous four modules. e.g. visualise the face, export the face to stl
